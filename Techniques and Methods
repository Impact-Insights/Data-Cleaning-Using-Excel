First Thing First.
-Create a backup copy of the original data in a separate workbook. This is to ensure that you can always go back if you have made changes you want to revert back.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The first thing to note is the format and types of data your dataset contains.

--Dates.
  -It is wise to be consistent with the format used to indicate dates in our data.
--Currency.
  -To make sure that our data is consistent in different applications(SQL, Python, etc..) we can name our column to show that the data contained in currency and format
    the values as numbers.
--City Zip Codes.
  -Merging and Splitting Columns.(When having mixed data)
--Cellphone numbers.
--Numbers in general.
--Text/Strings.

In most cases calculations/analysis is done on numerical values and visuailisation on data like location (Demographics),
categorical data and numerical values of course.

There are a multiple issues that you can come across when working with large datasets that contain all sorts of data types.
--Duplicates
--Spelling Erros
--Date formats(Depending on the region you are in.)
--Letter Cases(UPPER, LOWER, PROPER).
--Unneccessary spaces and non-printing charaters between words or numbers.
--Blank entries.

-Remove duplicate 
- Edit name: use UPPER, Lower or Proper function
- Use filter to look for spelling errors
- Trim white space: TRIM function
- Issue with numerical data: currency, dates
